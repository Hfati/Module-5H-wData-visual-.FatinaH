In this Challenge, I am asked to apply what I have learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset. Hypothetically, I just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer.
As a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, I have been granted access to the complete data from our most recent animal study. This study involved 249 mice with SCC tumors treated with various drug regimens over 45 days. The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, with other treatment regimens.
The executive team has entrusted me with the crucial task of generating all the necessary tables and figures for the clinical study's technical report. Also, I'd like to provide a comprehensive top-level summary of the study results, a significant task for the company's future decisions.
 To analyze the assignment, it has to be  broken down into the following tasks:
Prepare the data.
Generate summary statistics.
Create bar charts and pie charts.
Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
Calculate correlation and regression.
Submit your final analysis.
